# Orchard Technical Test

- All elements on the page are bespoke including the tree menu.
- The structure of the CSS is based on snook.ca's [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/)
- I used one sprite, but you can check out my custom rake task for building them
	- it goes into the images folder and creates sprites from any folders it finds there
